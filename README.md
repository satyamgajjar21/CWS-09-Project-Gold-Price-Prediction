# Gold Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting gold prices using machine learning techniques. Historical financial data is analyzed to identify patterns and trends that influence gold prices. The trained model predicts future gold prices based on past observations.

Gold price prediction is widely used in finance, investment planning, and economic analysis. This project demonstrates practical application of regression based machine learning models.

## Problem Statement
Gold prices fluctuate due to market demand, inflation, currency value, and global economic factors. Manual analysis of historical trends is complex and time consuming. This project aims to automate gold price prediction using machine learning models trained on historical data.

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of historical gold price data with features such as date and price values. The data is cleaned and structured to make it suitable for time based and regression analysis.

## Technologies Used
Python  
Jupyter Notebook  
Pandas  
NumPy  
Matplotlib  
Seaborn  
Scikit learn  

## Project Workflow
Data loading and inspection  
Data cleaning and preprocessing  
Exploratory data analysis  
Feature selection and transformation  
Model training  
Model evaluation  
Prediction on test data  

## Data Preprocessing
Handling missing values  
Formatting date and time features  
Scaling numerical values  
Splitting dataset into training and testing sets  

## Feature Engineering
Relevant features are selected from historical data to improve predictive performance. Time based patterns are considered during model training.

## Machine Learning Models
Linear Regression  
Decision Tree Regressor  
Random Forest Regressor  

These models are used to compare performance and identify the best predictor for gold prices.

## Model Training
Models are trained using historical gold price data. The learning process minimizes prediction error by fitting patterns between input features and output price values.

## Model Evaluation
Model performance is evaluated using regression metrics such as mean squared error, root mean squared error, and R squared score to measure prediction accuracy.

## Results
The trained models are able to predict gold prices with reasonable accuracy. Ensemble based models perform better in capturing non linear market trends.
